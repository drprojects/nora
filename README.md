A Notion template to help you keep track of the papers you read, their authors, 
your notes and more üöÄ‚ö°üî•

</div>

<br>

## üìå¬†¬†Introduction

This project was built as a [Notion](https://www.notion.so)-based alternative to 
reference management softwares such as Zotero and Mendeley.

It is composed of the **NoRA Notion template** for you to build on top of, as 
well as **NoRA-Tools** to programmatically:
- üî• programmatically upload papers to your NORA library from **arxiv**, **Elsevier Scopus**, **Springer**, or **HAL**
- üî• move all your Zotero library to your NoRA library

### üß™¬†¬†NoRA template

The NoRA template provides you with a structure of interconnected databases to 
keep track of your research papers and notes.
More specifically, the template contains the following databases:
- `üèóÔ∏è¬†Projects`
- `üìú¬†Papers`
- `üë§¬†People`
- `üè¢¬†Affiliations`
- `ü§π¬†Conferences & journals`
- `üß≤¬†Key topics`

The inner workings of the template are quite straightforward, the best way to 
get familiar with it is probably to play with it üòâ !

### üõ†¬†¬†NoRA-Tools

The NoRA-Tools provide functionalities to programmatically upload data to your 
NoRA template. For now, the main functionalities are:

- uploading an arxiv paper (and associated metadata) to NoRA
- uploading an Elsevier paper from Scopus (and associated metadata) to NoRA
- uploading a Springer paper (and associated metadata) to NoRA
- uploading a HAL paper (and associated metadata) to NoRA
- uploading your whole Zotero library to NoRA 

You can freely modify or extend the NoRA template. However, keep in mind that if 
you want to use NoRA-Tools after modifying some sensitive page fields, you will 
need to adjust your [Notion configuration](###notion-configuration) accordingly.

<br>

## üß±¬†¬†Installation

### Installing the template

Simply duplicate the [NoRA template](https://silent-switch-780.notion.site/Template-research-library-286d3393a7e845c6a689a5c693790987) to your personal Notion account.

### Installing NoRA tools

First, install the NoRA-Tools locally on your machine.

```bash
# clone project
git clone git@github.com:drprojects/nora.git
cd nora

# create a 'nora' conda environment with required dependencies
conda env create -f nora.yml
```

### Notion configuration

Next, you will need to configure your NoRA-Tools to connect to your NoRA databases in Notion.
To this end, do the following:
- [Create an integration](https://developers.notion.com/docs/create-a-notion-integration) for your NoRA workspace
- [Recover your **API secret token**](https://developers.notion.com/docs/create-a-notion-integration#get-your-api-secret)
- For each database in the NoRA template (ie Papers, People, Affiliations, Venues, Topics):
  - [Give your integration permission to access this database](https://developers.notion.com/docs/create-a-notion-integration#give-your-integration-page-permissions)
  - Recover your **database ID**. For this, open the database page **in a browser**. The
database ID is a 32-alphanumeric-character that can be recovered from the URL of the page:
`https://www.notion.so/this_is_your_32_character_database_id?v=you_can_ignore_the_rest`

Once you have recovered your **API secret token** and the **database IDs**, you must save 
these in the `configs/notion/default.yaml` file:

````yaml
# Adapt to your own Notion library.
# See https://developers.notion.com/docs/create-a-notion-integration
token: "your_api_secret_token"
papers_db_id: "your_papers_database_id"
people_db_id: "your_people_database_id"
affiliations_db_id: "your_affiliations_database_id"
venues_db_id: "your_venues_database_id"
topics_db_id: "your_topics_database_id"
````

<details>
<summary><b>‚ö†Ô∏è Want to modify some field names in NoRA ?Ô∏è</b></summary>

By default, NoRA-Tools expect the attribute fields (eg column names in Notion) of your papers, people, etc. to have specific values.
If you want to adjust those, you will also need to adjust the `configs/notion/default.yaml` file:

````yaml
# If you happen to modify your field names in Notion, update the
# following database-specific keys
person_keys:
    name: 'Name'
    affiliations: 'üè¢ Affiliations'
    papers: 'üìú Papers'
    website: 'Website'

paper_keys:
    name: 'Name'
    authors: 'üë§ Authors'
    abstract:  'Abstract'
    topics: 'üß≤ Key topics'
    url: 'URL'
    to_read: 'Reading status'
    year: 'Year'
    venue:  'ü§π Venue'

affiliation_keys:
    name: 'Name'

venue_keys:
    name: 'Name'
````

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>
‚ö†Ô∏è Want to add your own ü§π¬†Conferences & journals ?Ô∏è</b></summary>

By default, when parsing a paper from a remote database, NoRA-Tools will try to 
figure out which `ü§π¬†Conferences & journals` to place it under. However, one 
can hardly account for all possible conference and journal names, nor for all 
the slight formatting differences used to describe how a paper was published. 
Yet, we attempt to group the most frequent ones using a predefined `VENUES` 
dictionary in `src/utils/venues.py`.

If many papers from your library are from a conference or journal absent from 
this dictionary, and you would like them to be grouped under the same 
`ü§π¬†Conferences & journals` item, you can simply append your own entries in 
`VENUES`, using the following format:

````python
lowercase_match_to_search_for_in_remote_metadata: 'shorthand_under_which_to_group'
````

</details>

### Elsevier configuration (optional)

If you intend to upload papers from Elsevier to Notion, you will need to configure your
NoRA-Tools accordingly.
To this end, you will need to [create an Elsevier **API key**](https://dev.elsevier.com).

You can then save your Elsevier **API key** in the `configs/elsevier/default.yaml` 
file:

````yaml
# Adapt to your own Elsevier account.
# See https://dev.elsevier.com
api_token: 'your_api_key'
````

### Springer configuration (optional)

If you intend to upload papers from Springer to Notion, you will need to configure your 
NoRA-Tools accordingly.
To this end, you will need to [create a Springer **API key**](https://docs-dev.springernature.com/docs).

You can then save your Springer **API key** in the `configs/springer/default.yaml` 
file:

````yaml
# Adapt to your own Springer account.
# See https://docs-dev.springernature.com/docs
api_key: 'your_api_key'
````

### Zotero configuration (optional)

If you intend to move your whole Zotero library to Notion, you will need to configure 
your NoRA-Tools accordingly.
To this end, you will need to:
- Get your Zotero **library ID** by checking the UserID in your [profile settings](https://www.zotero.org/settings/keys)
- Create a Zotero **API key** in your [profile settings](https://www.zotero.org/settings/keys)

You can then save your Zotero **library ID** and **API key** in the 
`configs/zotero/default.yaml` file:

````yaml
# Adapt to your own Zotero library
library_id: 'your_library_id'
api_token: 'your_api_key'
````

By default, the `collections` (eg folders) in your Zotero library will be used to 
populate the `Key Topics` field of your papers in NoRA.
If you want to exclude some of your collections from this behavior, your can list 
them in:

````yaml
ignored_collections: ['collection name 1', 'collection name 2']
````

### Proxy configuration (optional)

If your machine has a proxy, you will need to configure your NoRA-Tools to use it.
To this end, specify your `$HTTP_PROXY` and `$HTTPS_PROXY` in the 
`configs/proxy/default.yaml` file:

````yaml
http_proxy: 'your_http_proxy'
https_proxy: 'your_https_proxy'
````
